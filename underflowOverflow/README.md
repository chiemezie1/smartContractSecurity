# Integer Overflow and Underflow Prevention with SafeMath

## Overview
This project demonstrates the concept of integer overflow and underflow in Solidity and provides a solution using the SafeMath library. Integer overflow and underflow can occur when performing arithmetic operations on integers that exceed their maximum or minimum values, leading to unexpected and potentially dangerous behavior. SafeMath is a library that provides arithmetic functions with overflow and underflow protection, ensuring the safety of mathematical calculations.

**Solution**
Use the SafeMath functions for arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflow and underflow.

## Examples
Let's look at some code examples to understand how SafeMath prevents integer overflow and underflow.

### Addition Example
```solidity
uint256 a = 2**256 - 1;
uint256 b = 1;
uint256 c = a + b;  // Throws an overflow exception without SafeMath
uint256 d = a.add(b);  // Safely adds a and b using SafeMath
In this example, without SafeMath, the addition of a and b would result in an overflow, throwing an exception. However, by using a.add(b) with SafeMath, the addition is performed safely, and an exception is prevented.

Subtraction Example
solidity
Copy code
uint256 a = 0;
uint256 b = 1;
uint256 c = a - b;  // Throws an underflow exception without SafeMath
uint256 d = a.sub(b);  // Safely subtracts b from a using SafeMath
In this example, without SafeMath, the subtraction of b from a would result in an underflow, throwing an exception. By using a.sub(b) with SafeMath, the subtraction is performed safely, and an exception is avoided.
```

Other Arithmetic Operations
SafeMath provides additional functions for multiplication (mul) and division (div), which offer the same protection against overflow and underflow.

Conclusion
Integer overflow and underflow can lead to vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior in Solidity contracts. SafeMath provides a solution by offering arithmetic functions with built-in checks to prevent these issues. By using SafeMath, you can ensure the integrity and safety of your contract's arithmetic operations.
